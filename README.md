### Tips and Tricks ###

.net â€”info

Create new webapi over cli
dotnet new webapi -n API

Create new class library over cli
dotnet new classlib -n Domain

add "Domain" project to solution with 
dotnet sln add Domain/

Add references between projects
Domain project is the center
Application needs dependency to Domain and Persistence

We go to the Application project and add ref to the Domain project
Cd application
dotnet add reference ../Domain

API needs a reference to our Application project

Persistence needs a reference to Domain

dotnet run -p API/ - set API as startup project and run
http://localhost:5000/api/values

Setup db with sqlite without a db server
opt.UseSqlite(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API

Add seed migration
dotnet ef migrations add SeedValues -p Persistence -s API/

It is recommended to make all db calls async

localhost:5000/api/values/1

Create react app
socialNetwork adisamrvoljak$ npx create-react-app client-app --use-npm --typescript
Npm start (in client-app folder)

We use axios to make http requests
Npm install axios

Npm install semantic-ui-react

dotnet ef migrations add "ActivityEntityAdded" -p Persistence -s API

We want EF to create the Guide

Event store architecture - store events on db - we will not use
mediatR

Install mediate package 
MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection

Add hanger where we will query the db

Add mediatR to our services. We need to pass the assembly where the list and query is in

Details and list are our queries 
But creating data and updating is a command

if(success) return Unit.Value;
Returns an empty object, but this is what we need know for our api handler. It will returns a 200 reposes which is enough
